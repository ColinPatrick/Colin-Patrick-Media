  <p class="artOneBody">In the same way that people throughout history have sought out the rush of adrenaline provided by extreme sports or wild amusement rides, countless moviegoers long for the thrill of "danger" in their entertainment. Like those that pay for admittance to a haunted house or for the chance to go skydiving, certain audiences look to the cinematic experience to get their hearts racing in a safe and controlled environment. This market has led to the production of thousands of horror films, some of which have seen a fair bit of success and popularity around the world. Yet some people dismiss the genre as a long line of subpar and cheesy films, and to their credit, some of them are. Plus, the nature of a horror film is to directly oppose the natural instinct to stay in a state of psychological well-being. People don't fight the urge to laugh during a comedy, but when they witness something frightening the mind impulsively tries to rationalize the situation and calm itself. This can make it hard for some people to give into the experience of even the best horror films. </p>

  <p class="artOneBody">Admittedly, horror isn't for everyone. Some people turn to cinema for a relaxing and uplifting source of fun, not as a way to challenge themselves and their comfort zones. But others have written the genre off altogether because of the problems associated with the worst horror movies, and this is a mistake. The predictable writing, campy nature and poor performances that people tend to think of are not as widespread throughout these films as one might think. In fact, many of these movies have been regarded as brilliant works of art, and those who ignore them in their entirety may be surprised at how much they are missing out.</p>

  <p class="artOneBody">Horror movies are also some of the hardest to properly execute due to the need to effectively challenge the viewers, but they are also filled with the potential for great storytelling. A strong narrative must create a problem that needs solving to invest the audience and give them a sense of closure when the story ends. In a scary movie, this conflict is all the more crucial as it needs to convincingly terrorize and test the characters in brutal ways. When the story has good writing and the characters are compelling, this emphasis on the conflict leads to an added layer of tension as the film progresses, and the fact that these stories sometimes end in tragedy set real stakes for the plot. When the supernatural entity in the movie Poltergeist captures a young child, the movie achieves a real tension because it has allowed us to become attached to the parents and to the child, whose survival is now an uncertainty. Horrifying conflicts like this also benefit by being able to touch on some provocative themes and ideas. Death, loss, religion and morality are often central to these story-lines, and when handled with finesse it can lead to some profound depth in works of horror. </p>

  <p class="artOneBody">The potential for strong ideas and storytelling is not the only thing that people who avoid horror films are deprived of. They are missing out on a tradition that is hundreds of years old and has continued to be perfected over time. Scary stories have been a part of human culture throughout history, and while much of this traditional lore has been incarnated into film it has also evolved with modern media. While horror movies have learned from centuries of mythology and folklore, they have also begun to experiment with the format we have come to expect. Films like The Cabin in the Woods and Scream act as meta deconstructions of the horror genre, while movies in the vain of Mother! opt for abstract and metaphorical storytelling rather than utilizing a structured plot. Other films share a cinematic universe or act as a social commentary, and these are a small fraction of the ways that horror has grown along with modern cinema. This innovation has made a home for new artistic visions and outstanding performances in the world of horror, further adding to the library of films worth watching. With so much to gain from the history of scary stories and the future of visual media, there has truly never been a better time to explore the horror genre.</p>

  <p class="artOneBody">Perhaps the biggest oversight of those who don't give horror a chance is the sheer diversity of the stories it can tell. "Horror" is a broad category that encompasses a wide range of styles, tones, and sub-genres. Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland are both able to craft a zombie horror film into a comedy, while a film like The Witch sets a dark and disturbing tone as a 17th century period piece. Plenty of much more specific categories exist too, from "found footage" films to works of "body horror". Believe it or not, musical horror is a thing, too. The best films know how to blend the strengths of different genres together, and the same applies to horror. Those who dismiss these films because they belong that general class aren't ignoring a single genre, they are missing out on a wide array of different works of art, each capable of leaving its own unique impression.</p>

  <p class="artOneBody">Horror movies are not a small niche of cinema that are here to depict haunted houses and teen killing psychopaths in masks. They are a full spectrum of films that can tell tense and thought-provoking stories and still deliver an entertaining experience to moviegoers. No genre is inherently bad, not when they are so large and constantly fluctuating. Those who turn a blind eye to these films may find that they greatly enjoy some of them if they give the genre a chance. Some people would even argue that even the worst horror films are at least more entertaining than those of other genres. The bottom line is that some great things are happening in horror, including some of the most iconic moments in movie history. Practically everyone knows what the shower scene from Psycho is, or what happens at the end of The Sixth Sense. These are two examples out of hundreds of brilliant moments that have come from these films, and new ones are created all the time. Those who have neglected this genre are missing out on every single one of them.</p>
