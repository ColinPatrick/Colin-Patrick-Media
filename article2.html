    <p class="artTwoBody">As technology advances every year there has never been a better time to be a gamer, but it has also become an expensive hobby. Popular games run anywhere from $50 to $100, and every few years the consoles they are played on become obsolete as new ones are released for hundreds of dollars. This has made the task of building a sizable gaming library a venture that can set gamers back thousands of dollars. Fortunately, another option is out there. Steam is a free app available for Mac and PC that features a large market of obscure and popular games for great prices, and allows the user easy access to each of them through the app's interface. On top of its already great deals, Steam is also known to have frequent sales and markdowns that make these prices even better. This will make the task of building your library easier on your wallet, and since these games are downloaded to your computer you never need to buy another gaming console again. A well-built and upgraded computer will last longer than the latest consoles while maintaining consistently better graphics to boot. </p>

    <p class="artTwoBody">With over 25,000 games available on the market, Steam offers both the latest releases and the popular classics, as well as thousands of independent titles. You will be able to find great deals on most of the games available for consoles, and the seasonal Steam sales can slash 50%, 75%, or even 90% off of their original price. That $50 game you've been wanting might be $10 or less on Steam at the right time of the year. Each purchased game has a "Steam link" code associated with it, which makes it simple for users to gift games to one another. All you have to do is buy a game as a "gift", and then send the code you receive to whoever you would like to give the game to. Steam link codes also allow outside promotions to offer their own great deals on Steam games. One such outside source is HumbleBundle, a site that offers a different bundle of games each week for one low price. Each bundle is available in different tiers with the highest tier offering more games for a slightly higher price, and the lowest tier providing fewer games for the lowest price- sometimes for a couple of dollars! Once you get the bundle you are provided with the codes for each game, which you can either add to your own library or send to a friend as a gift. Through HumbleBundle and other outside sites you will be amazed at how fast your library will grow without you breaking the bank. You can even find free game codes being offered from gaming communities such as those found on reddit.</p>

    <p class="artTwoBody">Steam also has some useful features that enhance the community as well as the experience of buying and playing games. Users create profiles that not only showcase their gaming achievements and screenshots, but also allows them to rate and review the games on the market. Each game features a store-page that displays the game's detailed reviews and average user rating. This will help you decide which games match your own interests and whether the game is worth buying. If you find a game with positive feedback but are unsure about purchasing it at the current price, you can add it to your wishlist. Steam has several sales over the course of a year, and users are notified as soon as the price of any item on their wishlist drops. Having a profile on Steam also improves the social aspect of gaming, as the whole experience is designed to make it easy for users to meet new players and chat with one another outside of and during game play. Steam acts like a social network for gamers, and as a part of that you can keep track of what your friends are playing and work together in-game to form an unbeatable squad!</p>

    <p class="artTwoBody">Steam has a lot of appealing features for gaming enthusiasts, but people often hesitate to use it because they don't want to play on a computer. One common misgiving is that people want to play with a TV and a controller rather than with a keyboard and a monitor, and another is that they are hesitant to make the initial investment of buying a gaming PC. But these issues can be fixed, and they actually lead into some of the biggest reasons that gaming on a computer is superior to using a console. A computer can connect to your TV instead of a monitor, or you can have both at once. You don't have to use a keyboard and mouse to play, either. In fact, unlike a console that is limited to its own brand of controller, you can find hundreds of different options of controllers that work with a computer. Computers also have more choices for headsets, mics, and VR equipment than any console on the market. As far as the other issue is concerned, the investment in a gaming computer is not as daunting as it may seem. A lot of homes already have a computer that can be upgraded to have better graphics, frame rates, and general specs than any gaming system. Those that don't already have a computer can buy the parts individually at a rate they can afford, and can assemble them using online tutorials. With a computer to play on you will save money in the long run by not having to constantly buy new consoles, and as a bonus you won't have to pay extra to pay online. In the end, consoles are basically weaker computers with less functionality, and nearly every aspect of gaming is improved on a PC.</p>

    <p class="artTwoBody">Those that are interested don't need to jump in all at once. You can use any computer or laptop you have available to test the waters and see how you like it. Steam is 100% free to download, and it even has some free games that are popular and highly rated. Other games are so cheap they are practically free, and you can also get started by looking into outside promotions like HumbleBundle. Be sure to also browse through the gaming community on Steam and reddit to see if you find any free giveaways. You have nothing to lose, and only new games to gain! You can always upgrade your experience as you go along, and once you've done that you will be free of the cycle of having to buy a new console every time they are released. For now, go download Steam for free and see what you've been missing! </p>
